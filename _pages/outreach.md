## Graduate Climate Conference
I currently serve as a co-chair of the 2023 [Graduate Climate Conference](https://graduateclimateconference.github.io/) and served as a conference organizer in 2022. The GCC is an interdisciplinary conference run entirely by graduate students, for graduate students.

## Joint Program - Applicant and Support Knowledgbase (JP-ASK)
I have been involved in [JP-ASK](https://mit.whoi.edu/admissions/apply/jp-applicant-support-knowledgebase-jp-ask/) as a mentor since 2020 and as an executive board member since 2021. JP-ASK pairs prospective graduate student applicants to current graduate students in the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program](https://mit.whoi.edu/) with the goal of demystifying the graduate school application process to students underrepresented in the ocean sciences.

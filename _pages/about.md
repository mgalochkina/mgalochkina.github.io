I'm a third year PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography](https://mit.whoi.edu/) advised by Drs. [Anne Cohen](https://www2.whoi.edu/site/cohenlab/) and [Delia Oppo](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/doppo/). I'm broadly interested in understanding how tropical oceans and coral reefs have responded to past and present climate variability. More specifically, my research explores the links between basin-scale marine heatwaves, the amplitude and spatial structure of heat anomalies, and the coral response to extreme heat across a shallow water coral reef. Through my research, I aim to develop a better understanding of coral reef thermal tolerance thresholds through time as well as revise predictions of 21st century coral reef survivorship, bleaching, and mortality across tropical basins. 

I graduated from Rutgers University in 2020 with a degree in Geology and minors in Physics and Marine Science. At Rutgers, I conducted research on North Atlantic sea surface and thermocline temperature changes following the Miocene Climatic Optimum, advised by Drs. [Kenneth Miller](https://geology.rutgers.edu/people-directory/19-faculty/242-kenneth-g-miller) and [Maria Makarova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-makarova-16741360).
